The Vaccine dynamic web application, developed using the CodeIgniter framework, PHP,
SQL database, and Apache server, is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate
efficient vaccine management, hospital registration, and user vaccination appointments.
At the core of the application are three interconnected modules: Admin, Hospital, and
User, each playing a distinct yet crucial role in the system's functionality.
The Admin module serves as the central authority, overseeing the entire application's
operations. Admins have the privilege to create and manage vaccine categories,
ensuring a well-organized structure for vaccine management within the system. This
administrative control ensures that the application maintains data integrity and follows
predefined guidelines.
Hospitals are a vital component of the application, requiring registration and approval
from the admin to join the system. This meticulous registration process guarantees that
only legitimate hospitals are part of the platform, enhancing trust and reliability.
Approved hospitals gain access to their dedicated accounts, where they can add
vaccines to predefined categories. Detailed information such as vaccine quantity, price,
and timing allows hospitals to effectively manage their vaccine inventory.
On the user side, individuals seeking vaccination services can browse through
registered hospitals based on their proximity and preferences. The user interface is
designed for intuitive navigation, enabling users to select hospitals and explore
available vaccine categories. Users can then request vaccine appointments from their
chosen hospital.
The booking process involves validation and approval on the hospital's end, ensuring a
streamlined and secure appointment system. Users proceed to make payments through
integrated payment gateways, receiving digital receipts upon successful transactions.
These receipts serve as confirmation of payment and appointment details, providing
users with a seamless experience.
In summary, the Vaccine dynamic web application offers a robust platform for vaccine
management and appointment scheduling. Its modular architecture, coupled with
administrative controls and user-friendly interfaces, ensures efficient operations and a
positive experience for hospitals and users alike
